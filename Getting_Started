Airflow
##  A quick-start guide for Airflow is available from
##  https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/start/local.html
##  It is recommended that you don't use the default SequentialExecutor and 
##  MySQLite backend database unless your project is very basic. This 
##  project uses LocalExecutor and MySQL as the backend, but currently
##  would run fine with default settings.

Putting Files on EC2 and Setting Up Environment:
## Run sftp code below in local terminal to upload this folder to EC2 instance 
## (I'm using a Mac terminal)

## It is important to do this manually at least once so the EC2 instance is added
## to your local machines list of known_hosts.

## Default EC2 user is ec2-user. Replace if you are using a different user. Exclude asterisks
sftp -i *PATH TO YOUR KEY PEM FILE* ec2-user@*PUBLIC IPv4 DNS OF YOUR INSTANCE*
## To transfer project folder to EC2 
put -r *PATH TO PROJECT FOLDER*
## Optional: specify destination folder after path to project folder


## Install Chrome on EC2 instance
sudo curl https://intoli.com/install-google-chrome.sh | bash
sudo mv /usr/bin/google-chrome-stable /usr/bin/google-chrome
google-chrome --version && which google-chrome

## Install Chromedriver on EC2 instance
## Make sure to install correct Chromedriver for your version of Chrome
cd /tmp/
sudo wget https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/105.0.5195.19/chromedriver_linux64.zip
sudo unzip chromedriver_linux64.zip
sudo mv chromedriver /usr/bin/chromedriver
chromedriver --version


## Check python3 version installed on EC2
yum list installed | grep -i python3


## Upgrade pip if necessary
pip3 install pip --upgrade

## Install requirements.txt
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

## Ready to run scripts on EC2

cd PROJECTFOLDER;python3 script.py
